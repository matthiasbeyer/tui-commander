You're more than welcome contributing to this crate!
If you have ideas, feel free to add them to the issues - but I'd welcome PRs even more!

Make sure to run `cargo fmt` or, even better, `nix fmt` on each individual
commit. In fact, CI confirms that your PR is formatted, but each commit should
be formatted as well. Your commits should also be signed off (`git commit --signoff`).
