Current state: This is total shit.

I wrote it before I properly understood how ratatui is supposed to be used.
It does work, but it cannot be easily integrated into a ratatui application.

And I do not have the time to reimplement it properly right now. So you most
likely don't want to use this, OR, if you are awesome (and I know you are), you
can PR me fixes for this.
